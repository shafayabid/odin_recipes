    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
        <li>4 carrots, halved</li>
        <li>4 stalks celery, halved</li>
        <li>1 large onion, halved</li>
        <li>water to cover</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons prepared mustard</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon granules (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place chicken, carrots, celery, and onion in a large soup pot; add enough cold water to cover. 
            Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until meat falls off of the bone, 
            about 90 minutes. Skim off foam every so often, as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove chicken from the pot and let sit until cool enough to handle; chop meat into pieces, 
            and discard skin and bones.
        </li>
        <li>
            Strain out vegetables, reserving the stock; rinse the soup pot and return the stock to the pot. 
            Chop vegetables into smaller pieces; return chopped chicken and vegetables to the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
            Warm soup until heated through; season with salt, pepper, and chicken bouillon to taste.
        </li>
    </ol>
